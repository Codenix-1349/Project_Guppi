## 📖 Overview

**Project Guppi** is a turn-based 3D strategy prototype developed with **Godot 4** and **GDScript**.

The project emphasizes:

- Procedural galaxy generation  
- Modular manager-based architecture  
- Turn-based orchestration  
- Resource simulation  
- Drone production systems  
- Automated combat resolution  
- Integrated battle logging  

It demonstrates scalable game system design and structured scene architecture within Godot.

## ✨ Core Gameplay Systems

## 🔄 Turn-Based Orchestration

Each turn progresses through a structured multi-phase pipeline:

### 1️⃣ Planning Phase
The player issues commands (movement, production, system interactions) and confirms the turn.

### 2️⃣ Execution Phase
Execution Phase (placeholder) – reserved for action sequencing / animation playback (e.g., mothership movement between star systems, drone deployment, scouting operations and Fog-of-War reveal).


### 3️⃣ Resolve Phase
Core turn mechanics are processed:

- Resource extraction (MiningManager)
- Production completion (PrinterManager)
- Energy regeneration (level-scaled cap)
- Enemy encounter detection
- Combat initiation (if hostile presence exists)

If combat is triggered, the turn flow pauses until the encounter is resolved.

### 4️⃣ Event Phase
Post-resolution effects are processed:

- Event / anomaly handling
- XP calculation
- Level progression
- Turn counter increment

The game then transitions back to the Planning Phase.


### Progression System
- XP gained from scans and victories  
- Level-ups increase:
  - Maximum energy capacity  
  - Maximum hull integrity (HP)  
- Energy restored on level-up

## 🧠 Technical Architecture

### Scene Structure (Godot Node-Based)

```
Main3D
 ├── Managers
 │    ├── TurnManager
 │    ├── CombatManager
 │    ├── MiningManager
 │    ├── ScanManager
 │    ├── PrinterManager
 │    └── GalaxyMap3D
 │
 ├── UI
 │    ├── ResourceBar
 │    ├── TurnInfo
 │    ├── ActionButtons
 │    └── CombatLog
```

### Script-Based System Separation

- `TurnManager.gd`
- `CombatManager.gd`
- `MiningManager.gd`
- `ScanManager.gd`
- `PrinterManager.gd`
- `GalaxyMap3D.gd`

Architecture Principles:

- Single-responsibility systems  
- Centralized turn-state control  
- Expandable modular design  
- Data-driven enemy logic
