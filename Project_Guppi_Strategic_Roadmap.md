# Project Guppi -- Strategic Roadmap

## 1. Core Turn Structure (Condensed & Clear)

To avoid phase overload, the turn system is streamlined into **four
major phases**:

### Turn Flow

1.  **Command Phase**
    -   Movement (Jump)
    -   Scanning
    -   Assigning units
    -   Building units
    -   Upgrades
2.  **Execution Phase**
    -   Production completes
    -   Resources are collected
    -   Automated processes resolve
3.  **Conflict Phase**
    -   Combat resolution
    -   Battle log feedback
    -   Unit losses & damage application
4.  **Resolution Phase**
    -   Random events
    -   XP gain
    -   Level check
    -   Unlock notifications

This keeps the system readable while preserving structure.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Progression System Rework

Leveling must feel impactful.

### Level Up Effects

-   Ship module expansion (visual & mechanical)
-   New unit types unlocked
-   New production modules unlocked
-   Passive bonuses (energy regen, mining efficiency, defense bonus)

### Visual Ship Evolution

Each level unlock allows upgrading one module: - Weapon systems
(railgun, missile battery, beam cannon) - Engine module (jump range /
efficiency) - Shield array (damage mitigation) - Hull reinforcement (max
HP) - EMP module (combat utility)

Upgrades should be visually represented on the mothership model.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Enemy Design Philosophy

Instead of simple level scaling:

### Sector-Based Difficulty

-   Galaxy divided into sectors
-   Each sector introduces stronger enemy archetypes
-   Player feels stronger when returning to earlier sectors

### Enemy Evolution

New enemy classes instead of pure stat scaling: - Swarm (numbers) -
Corsair (burst damage) - Fortress (heavy defense) - Carrier (spawns
drones) - Tech Faction (EMP, hacking)

Progression must feel empowering --- not offset by artificial scaling.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Faction & Diplomacy System

Introduce multiple factions with distinct traits:

### Example Factions

-   Militaristic Dominion (aggressive, strong fleets)
-   Trade Consortium (economic power, trade bonuses)
-   Technocratic Union (advanced tech, EMP units)
-   Nomad Clans (high mobility, hit-and-run)

### Diplomacy Features

-   Trade agreements
-   Ceasefire
-   Alliance
-   Espionage
-   Reputation system

Diplomacy creates alternative win paths beyond conquest.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Economy & Production Depth

Resource roles clarified:

-   Iron (FE): Base construction
-   Titanium (TI): Structural upgrades & modules
-   Uranium (U): Advanced tech & energy systems
-   Data: Research & events

### Production Improvements

-   Different build times per unit
-   Production queue slots
-   Permanent fabrication upgrades via Titanium

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Event System Expansion

Random events occur in Resolution Phase:

-   Distress signal
-   Abandoned wreck
-   Rogue AI
-   Trade opportunity
-   Sector anomaly

Each event includes: - Risk vs reward decision - Resource impact -
Reputation impact

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7. Planetary Development (Mid-Term Expansion)

Optional deeper layer:

-   Mining Hub
-   Research Lab
-   Defense Grid
-   Trade Port

Buildings affect: - Resource yield - Defense - Event probability -
Diplomacy leverage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 8. Combat System Upgrade Path

Enhance tactical clarity without overcomplexity:

-   Initiative system
-   Damage types (kinetic, energy, EMP)
-   Armor & shield separation
-   Target priority options
-   Clear battle report

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 9. Long-Term Vision

-   Technology tree
-   Multiple mothership instances (cloning mechanic)
-   Save / Load system
-   Modular architecture (TurnManager, CombatManager, EventManager,
    EconomyManager)
-   Steam-ready build polish

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Strategic Direction

Project Guppi evolves from a Proof of Concept into:

-   A sector-based strategic expansion game
-   With meaningful progression
-   Faction-driven politics
-   Visual ship evolution
-   Tactical but readable combat
-   Modular scalable architecture

The goal is clarity, depth, and long-term replayability.
